Module:
Module is a file which contains various Python functions and global variables. It is simply just .py extension file which has python executable code.

Package:
Package is a collection of modules. It must contains an __init__.py file as a flag so that the python interpreter processes it as such. 
The __init__.py could be an empty file without causing issues.

Library:
Library is a collection of packages.

Framework:
Framework is a collection of libraries. This is the architecture of the program.

OOPS- object-oriented programming system
based on 'object'
The basic concept of OOP is this: Class >> Object >> Instance.
* The class = the blue print.
* The Object is an actual thing that is built based on the 'blue print' (like the house).
* An instance is a virtual copy (but not a real copy) of the object.
A blueprint for a house design is like a class description. All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of 
that class. A given house is an instance.
object:
	* This object contain bundle of data and methods
	Objects have two characteristics: They have states and behaviors.
	Example:
		1) Object: House (class name)
		2) State: Address, Color, Area (class variable)
		3) Behavior: Open door, close door (methods)

1) Characteristics of Objects:
	If you find it hard to understand Abstraction and Encapsulation, do not worry as I have covered these topics in 
	detail with examples in the next section of this guide.

	* Abstraction
	* Encapsulation
	
	Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation:
		Abstraction is a mechanism which represent the essential features without including implementation details.
		Abstraction: — Implementation hiding.
		Encapsulation: — Information hiding.

	Abstraction: Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an 
	object from the user.

	Encapsulation: Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together. If you are 
	creating class, you are doing encapsulation.

	I) Python Abstraction:
		It is used to hide the internal details and only show the functionalities.
		Example:
	        Suppose you are going to an ATM to withdraw money. You simply insert your card and click some buttons and 
	        get the money. You don’t know what is happening internally on press of these buttons. Basically you are 
	        hiding unnecessary information from user. So, abstraction is a method to hide internal 
	        functionalities from user.

		Detail explain:
		A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method 
		that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract 
		methods must be implemented by its subclasses.

		Why use Abstract Base Classes :
			Abstract classes allow you to provide default functionality for the subclasses. Compared to interfaces 
			abstract classes can have an implementation. By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common 
			Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations 
			where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins in an application, but can also 
			help you when working on a large team or with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your head at the 
			same time is difficult or not possible.

		# Example is available in below link:
			# https://github.com/kumarmuthu/python_logic/blob/master/Abstraction/AbstractionExample.py

		# simple example:
			# Link: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/abstract-base-classes-in-python-abc
		import abc
		class Shape(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
		   @abc.abstractmethod
		   def area(self):
			  pass
		class Rectangle(Shape):
		   def __init__(self, x,y):
			  self.l = x
			  self.b=y
		   def area(self):
			  return self.l*self.b
		r = Rectangle(10,20)
		print ('area: ',r.area())

	II) Python Encapsulation:
		Hiding details of a class from other objects.
		Example:
				Suppose there is a tree. Now a tree can have its components like root, stem, branches, leaves, flowers 
				and fruits. It has some functionalities like Photosynthesis. But in a single unit we call it a tree. 
				In same way encapsulation is a characteristic to bind data members and functions in single unit.
				
		Private members:
			But there is a method in Python to define Private: Add “__” (double underscore ) in front of the variable 
			and function name can hide them when accessing them from out of class.
			Python doesn’t have real private methods, so one underline in the beginning of a method or attribute 
			means you shouldn’t access this method.But this is just convention.I can still access the the variables 
			with single underscore.
			Also when using double underscore (__).we can still access the private variables.
		# Example is available in below link:
			# https://github.com/kumarmuthu/python_logic/blob/master/Encapsulation/EncapsulationExample.py
		
		# simple example:
			#Link: https://medium.com/@manjuladube/encapsulation-abstraction-35999b0a3911
		# Example code:
		# Ex-1
		class Person:
		  def __init__(self):
			self.name = 'Muthu'
			self.__lastname = 'Kumar'

		  def PrintName(self):
			return self.name +' ' + self.__lastname

		#Outside class
		P = Person()
		print(P.name)
		print(P.PrintName())
		# print(P.__lastname)   # need this line
		print("Fixed private access: ",P._Person__lastname) # we able to print "Kumar" in __lastname
		#AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__lastname'

		# Ex-2
		class SeeMee:
		  def youcanseeme(self):
			return 'you can see me'

		  def __youcannotseeme(self):
			return 'you cannot see me'

		#Outside class
		Check = SeeMee()
		print(Check.youcanseeme())
		# you can see me
		# print(Check.__youcannotseeme())  # need this line
		#AttributeError: 'SeeMee' object has no attribute '__youcannotseeme'

		# Ex-3
		class SeeMee:
		  def youcanseeme(self):
			return 'you can see me'

		  def __youcannotseeme(self):
			return 'you cannot see me'

		#Outside class
		Check = SeeMee()
		print(Check.youcanseeme())
		print(Check._SeeMee__youcannotseeme())
		#Changing the name causes it to access the function


2) Characteristics of State:
	I) Class attributes(as variable)
		* class variable
			Class attributes belong to the class itself they will be shared by all the instances.
	II) Instance attributes
		* method variable
			Every object has its own copy of the instance attribute 
			(In case of class attributes all object refer to single copy)

	Standard Data Types:
		Numbers (Number data types store numeric values)
		String (Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks)
		List (mutable<can change> sequence data type [] )
		Tuple (immutable<can't change> sequence data type () )
		Dictionary

	Getter and Setter in Python(@property):
		The main purpose of using getters and setters in object-oriented programs is to ensure data encapsulation. 
		Private variables in python are not actually hidden fields like in other object oriented languages.

		In Python property()is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object. 
		A property object has three methods, getter(), setter(), and delete(). property() function in Python has 
		four arguments property(fget, fset, fdel, doc), fget is a function for retrieving an attribute value. 
		fset is a fuction for setting an attribute value. fdel is a function for deleting an attribute value. 
		doc creates a docstring for attribute. A property object has three methods, getter(), setter(), and delete()
		
		# Example is available in below link:	
		# https://github.com/kumarmuthu/python_logic/blob/Python_PropertyDecorator/PropertyDecorator/PropertyDecoratorWithGetterSetterDeleter.py
		
		# Example code:
		# Ex-1
		class MyClass:
			def __init__(self, age = 0):
				 self._age = age

			# getter method
			def get__age(self):
				return self._age

			# setter method
			def set__age(self, x):
				self._age = x


		cls_obj = MyClass()
		# setting the age using setter
		cls_obj.set__age(2)

		# retrieving age using getter
		print(cls_obj.get__age())

		# Ex-2
		class MyClasss:
			def __init__(self):
				self._age = 0

			# function to get value of _age
			def get_age(self):
				print("getter method called")
				return self._age

			# function to set value of _age
			def set_age(self, a):
				print("setter method called")
				self._age = a

			# function to delete _age attribute
			def del_age(self):
				print("before delete self dict: {}".format(self.__dict__))
				print("before delete: {}".format(self._age))
				del self._age
				print("after delete: {}".format(self.__dict__))

			age = property(get_age, set_age, del_age)


		mark = MyClasss()
		mark.age = 10
		print(mark.age)
		del mark.age

		# Ex-3
		class MyClasss:
			def __init__(self):
				self._age = 0

			# using property decorator
			# a getter function
			@property
			def age(self):
				print("getter method called")
				return self._age

			# a setter function
			@age.setter
			def age(self, a):
				if (a < 18):
					raise ValueError("Sorry you age is below eligibility criteria")
				print("setter method called")
				self._age = a
			
			# a deleter function
			@age.deleter
			def age(self):
				print("deleter method called")
				del self._age


		mark = MyClasss()
		mark.age = 19
		print(mark.age)
		del mark.age
		
		# Ex-4
		class MyClasss:
			def __init__(self):
				self._age = 0

			# using property decorator
			# a getter function
			@property
			def age(self):
				print("1 getter method called",self._age)
				return self._age

			# a getter function
			@age.getter
			def age(self):
			    print("2 getter method called",self._age)

			# a setter function
			@age.setter
			def age(self, a):
				if (a < 18):
					raise ValueError("Sorry you age is below eligibility criteria")
				print("setter method called")
				self._age = a
				
			# a deleter function
			@age.deleter
			def age(self):
				print("deleter method called")
				del self._age


		mark = MyClasss()
		mark.age = 19
		print(mark.age)
		del mark.age

3) Characteristics of Behavior:
	* Overriding vs. Overloading in Java:
		Overriding:
		Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). 
		One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class. Overriding allows a child class 
		to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.

		Overloading: (Not there in Python)
		Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

		Polymorphism applies to overriding, not to overloading.
		Overriding is a run-time concept while overloading is a compile-time concept.

	* Polymorphism in Python
		The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means same function name 
		(but different signatures) being uses for different types.

		1) Examples of used defined polymorphic functions :
			# A simple Python function to demonstrate
			# Polymorphism

			def add(x, y, z = 0):
				return x + y+z

			# Driver code
			print(add(2, 3))
			print(add(2, 3, 4))

		2) Polymorphism with class methods

			class India():
				def capital(self):
					print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

				def language(self):
					print("Hindi the primary language of India.")

				def type(self):
					print("India is a developing country.")

			class USA():
				def capital(self):
					print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

				def language(self):
					print("English is the primary language of USA.")

				def type(self):
					print("USA is a developed country.")

			obj_ind = India()
			obj_usa = USA()
			for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
				country.capital()
				country.language()
				country.type()

		3) Polymorphism with Inheritance
		In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the 
		methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. 
		However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. 
		This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit 
		the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of 
		re-implementing a method in the child class is known as "Method Overriding"

			class Bird:
			  def intro(self):
				print("There are many types of birds.")

			  def flight(self):
				print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

			class sparrow(Bird):
			  def flight(self):
				print("Sparrows can fly.")

			class ostrich(Bird):
			  def flight(self):
				print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

			obj_bird = Bird()
			obj_spr = sparrow()
			obj_ost = ostrich()

			obj_bird.intro()
			obj_bird.flight()

			obj_spr.intro()
			obj_spr.flight()

			obj_ost.intro()
			obj_ost.flight()

		4) Polymorphism with a Function and objects
		class India():
			def capital(self):
				print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

			def language(self):
				print("Hindi the primary language of India.")

			def type(self):
				print("India is a developing country.")

		class USA():
			def capital(self):
				print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

			def language(self):
				print("English is the primary language of USA.")

			def type(self):
				print("USA is a developed country.")

		def func(obj):
			obj.capital()
			obj.language()
			obj.type()

		obj_ind = India()
		obj_usa = USA()

		func(obj_ind)
		func(obj_usa)


	* Function
		A function is a block of code to carry out a specific task, will contain its own scope and is called by name. 
		All functions may contain zero(no) arguments or more than one arguments. On exit, a function can or can not 
		return one or more values.

		Basic function syntax
		def functionName( arg1, arg2,….):
		   # ……
		   # Function_body
		   # ……


	* Method
		A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. 
		Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.

		The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.

		The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.

		General Method Syntax
		class ClassName:
		   def method_name():
			  # …………
			  # Method_body
			  # ………………

str() vs repr() in Python
	str() is used for creating output for end user.
	while repr() is mainly used for debugging and development.
	repr’s goal is to be unambiguous and str’s is to be readable.

hasattr() method
	Its main task is to check if an object has the given named attribute and return true if present, else false.
PEP8:
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. 
It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.

Decoraror in Python:
A function that takes another functions as an argument.
Dynamically changing the functionality of a function without using sub classes.
Want to extend the funtionality of a function or dont want to modify them.

Comprehensions in Python:
a short and concise way to construct new sequences (such as lists, set, dictionary etc.)

lambda in Python:
Lambda is an anonymous function in Python, that can accept any number of arguments, 
but can only have a single expression

Python Scope:
A variable is only available from inside the region it is created(where it is defined that variable). 
This is called scope.
Local Scope
Global Scope

Namespace:
A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.
built-in namespace
global namespace
local namespace

generators in python:
Functions that return an iterable set of items are called generators.

iterators in Python:
In Python, iterators are used to iterate a group of elements, containers like list.
Iterator is an object.
It remembers its state i.e., where it is during iteration (see code below to see how)
__iter__() method initializes an iterator.
It has a __next__() method which returns the next item in iteration and points to the next element. 
Upon reaching the end of iterable object __next__() must return StopIteration exception.
It is also self iterable.
Iterators are objects with which we can iterate over iterable objects like lists, strings, etc.

memory managed in Python:
The memory allocated by the manager is in form of a private heap space dedicated for Python.
 All Python objects are stored in this heap and being private, it is inaccessible to the programmer.
Python has an in-built garbage collection to recycle the unused memory for the private heap space.

difference between Python Arrays and lists:
arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas lists can hold any data type elements.

Python packages:
Python packages are namespaces containing multiple modules.

Multithreading achieved in Python:
if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it’s usually not a good idea to use it.
Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). 
The GIL makes sure that only one of your ‘threads’ can execute at any one time. 
A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.
This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel, 
but they are really just taking turns using the same CPU core.

Inheritance in Python:
Inheritance allows One class to gain all the members(say attributes and methods) of another class. 
Inheritance provides code reusability, makes it easier to create and maintain an application. 
The class from which we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is inherited is called a derived / child class.

Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.
Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes
Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.

monkey patching in Python:
the term monkey patch only refers to dynamic modifications of a class or module at run-time.

Polymorphism in Python:
Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. 
So, for instance, if the parent class has a method named ABC then the child class also can have a method with the same name ABC having its own parameters and variables. 

encapsulation in Python:
Encapsulation means binding the code and the data together. A Python class in an example of encapsulation.

data abstraction in Python:
Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hiding the implementation from the world. 
It can be achieved in Python by using interfaces and abstract classes.

difference between .py and .pyc files:
.py files contain the source code of a program.
Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled files. If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. 
If not found, it checks for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file and then python virtual machine executes it.
.pyc file contains the bytecode of your program.

passed by value or by reference in python:
Pass by value: Copy of the actual object is passed. 
Changing the value of the copy of the object will not change the value of the original object.
Pass by reference: Reference to the actual object is passed. 
Changing the value of the new object will change the value of the original object.
In Python, arguments are passed by reference, i.e., reference to the actual object is passed.

Slice:
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9            ==>>> positive order
#   -1, -2, -3, -4, -, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10  ==>> negative order
